First we need to know about hof NFT is related to cryptography?
Though cryptocurrency and NFTs are not the same things, but mainstream investors can be forgiven for conflating the two.
Both are digital assets; and, while crypto came first, the general public began hearing about both around the same time in the late 2010s.
According to Forbes, NFTs are commonly bought and sold with crypto and both tend to attract the same players — the NFT world branched off from crypto culture.
Both are built using the same programming and encoded with the same underlying software and both are secured in digital wallets — but that’s where the similarities end.

Now the main part-> How Is An NFT Different From Cryptocurrency?
NFT stands for non-fungible token. It’s generally built using the same kind of programming as cryptocurrency, like Bitcoin or Ethereum, but that’s where the similarity ends.
Physical money and cryptocurrencies are “fungible,” meaning they can be traded or exchanged for one another. They’re also equal in value—one dollar is always worth another dollar; one Bitcoin is always equal to another Bitcoin. Crypto’s fungibility makes it a trusted means of conducting transactions on the blockchain.
NFTs are different. Each has a digital signature that makes it impossible for NFTs to be exchanged for or equal to one another (hence, non-fungible).
One NBA Top Shot clip, for example, is not equal to EVERYDAYS simply because they’re both NFTs. (One NBA Top Shot clip isn’t even necessarily equal to another NBA Top Shot clip, for that matter.)
